# Introduction
We collected the Amharic Hate Speech dataset from Twitter using the Twitter API over a period of 5 years, spanning from 2018-2022. Data Annotation was conducted using Yandex Toloka Cropwdsorcing Platform. Three independent annotators label each tweet and the gold labels are determined using a majority voting scheme.  Read our papers[URL to reased sooon] for more details about the dataset.
