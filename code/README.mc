# Introduction

In this code we use the [FLAIR](https://flairnlp.github.io/) framework to train the **FLAIR** and **RoBERTa** based models

## Instrcution 
1. First put the data into a data folder
2. Make sure to have GPU access to train the model
3. Run the comand `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python flair_train.py` to run the **FLAIR** model on a GPU 2
